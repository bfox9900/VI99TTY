VI99 TTY Text editor  alpha version  June 2023  Brian Fox 

                     VI99 TTY CHEATSHEET 

Extensive use is made of the Forth interpreter to reduce the program size.
If you enter an invalid command at the ':' in VI99, you will be bounced 
back into the shell program. The buffer you are editing is unchanged.
Re-enter editing with the 'e' command. 


Caveat:
The copy buffer is organized as a stack in this version.
This will change in future. 
Currently it can hold about 180 lines in VDP RAM. 
Be warned: It takes about 13 seconds to paste 150 lines. :-)
The stack buffer was not a good idea. Next version ...
